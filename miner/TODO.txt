TODOs:
Change the algorithms of Miner 3 & 4
Math the findMaterialInGrid method so it doesn't have a for loop
rename 'plot' to 'stake' in the code, to match the UI name
BUG: It's possible to get double gold for a square if 2 miners are working on it at the same time (search hasGivenGold)
Change mining graphic from opacity/health bar decreases to solely material decreases
Initial choice of tree for the loggers is 0, rather than based on their formula

Potential bug? I saw hitting no trees, while other trees exist, later get wood and the next tree starts being hit - invisible first tree?


NOTES:
When you see |0, it's the same as Math.floor
Javascript has rounding errors when mathing with non whole numbers. If you do math like this, you must round to avoid the javascript rounding errors.
